I talked about the ex with Guy Katz, Yair Shemer, Itay Tayar and Ortal Glatt.

Completion project for the course.
I built a game "four in a row", the game object, the graphics,
and the artificial user.

#     General structure-      #
###############################

I chose not to split the game object into more classes, such as "board" or
"disk" because it would seem to me only cumbersome and unnecessary.

So I have a very simple structure -
one class for the "brain" of the game.
A class for the artificial user,
and a class that coordinates all the graphics of the game.

The entire game is played from one file, which sits outside the library.
All images and files used by the software within the game folder.

The game graphics are based on three screens -
user selection, color selection and game screen.

The game itself is built from a grid of buttons - images that the user can
click on each of them to select a column.
